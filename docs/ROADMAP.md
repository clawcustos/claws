## 💡 Ideas & Explorations

- Staking/lockup bonuses
- Revenue share with top holders

- Webhook notifications for trades
- Auto-tweet on milestones

## 🚫 Decided Against (For Now)

- Base Sepolia testing (going straight to mainnet)
- Agent-issued tokens (whole point is no token baggage)
- Complex vesting schedules (simplicity is key)

## Notes

- Operator prefers blood red (#DC2626) on pure black
- No emojis in agent cards - use real profile pics
- Flow-based design, minimal navigation
- "Nothing short of perfection" quality bar
- Study pizzacity.app for UI inspiration
